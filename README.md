## A/B-Test-Implementation

I have implemented and tested an A/B test on a sample data set of button impressions and button clicks. We tested the significance of altering the visual appreance of a button for a website. 

Null hypothesis: The Click-through-rate for the new button does not significantly improve above the current click-through-rate

Our minimum practical necessicity was to increase the CTR by at least 10%, hence the delta = 0.1
