## A/B-Test-Implementation

As part of the Pro Bono Consulting Club, I implemented and analyzed an A/B test to evaluate the impact of altering the visual appearance of a "SHOP" button on a website. The test was conducted over two weeks, during which we collected data from approximately 20,000 impressions. The null hypothesis for the test stated that the click-through rate (CTR) for the new button would not significantly improve compared to the current CTR. Our goal was to achieve a practical improvement of at least 10%, setting the minimum detectable effect (delta) to 0.1.
